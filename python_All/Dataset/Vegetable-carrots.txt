Many people don't like eating carrots but I like them very much.
There are usually two kinds of carrots.
They are different in colours.One is orange,the other is light yellow,
They can be eaten either they are cooked or not cooked.
Mother often cooks them together with meat,
she says that carrots are very good for people's health.Carrots have rich nu-trition.
Please eat them more if you get some.
