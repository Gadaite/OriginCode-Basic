Last year, I went to the countryside to get my internship,
my duty was to be a teacher,
teaching the middle school students English.
At first, I was not used to the environment,
it was so different from the city I live in,
but I didnâ€™t want to give up,
so I insisted and got used to the new environment.
On the first day of being a teacher,
I was a little shy, but the students were kind,
they cooperated with me so much, I was so moved.
In the coming days, I became more and more confident,
I learned to be a good teacher, got along with the students,
we became friends soon. When I came home, the students were sad,
I also felt sad. I am so thankful for the internship experience,
it fosters me with the ability to get used to the new environment.
